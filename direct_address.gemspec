Direct Address provides you with address, country, and region classes. It also provides a generator which generates the necessary javascript and rake tasks to implement properly. You'll also get form helpers to easily implement Direct Address in your views. A rake task is provided that allows up to date country and region information to be downloaded from geoname.org.}
